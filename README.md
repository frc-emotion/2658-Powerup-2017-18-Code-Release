## Contributing
First, you must create your own branch. On IntelliJ, press `Ctrl + Shift + K`. Once the push window pops up, click on the branch,
which is after the colon. `master --> origin: gokul-branch`. Name your branch. This is the branch you must push to and commit changes to.

Pull requests let you tell others about changes
you've pushed to a GitHub repository. Once a pull request
is sent, interested parties can review the set of changes,
discuss potential modifications, and even push follow-up commits
if necessary. To create a pull request from your branch, go to your branch
on Github. Click on the `Pull requests` tab. Then, click on `New pull requests`.
The base should be `master`, while the compare should be your branch. Click `Create pull request`.
The title should be the main thing you changed, and in the body list all the minor changes you did.
After you create it, there should be a button called `Merge`. Do not click it. The team leads
will look over your work, and once they are satisfied, they will merge your branch and the main.
